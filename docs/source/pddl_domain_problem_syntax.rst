PDDL Domain & Problem Syntax
============================

The objective of these exercises is to use PDDL syntax to write domains and problems of automated planning.

Exercise 1: Bloksworld
----------------------

One famous domain in automated planning is blocksworld. In this domain, a robotic arm manipulates blocks placed on a table. It can pickup a block from the table, stack it on top of another block and build piles. Likewise, it can unstack
a block, put it down or stack it on another pile etc.

Exercise 2: Hanoi towers
------------------------

Exercise 3: N-puzzles
---------------------

Exercise 4: Graph coloring
--------------------------

Exercise 5: Pursuit-Evasion
---------------------------

Exercise 6: Turing Machine
--------------------------

Exercise 7: SAT solver
